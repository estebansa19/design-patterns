Creational - Prototype

Definition

Is a design pattern that lets you copy existing objects without making your code dependent on their
classes.

A real world analogy for this pattern, could be the process of mitotic cell division. After miotic
division, a pair of identicals cell is formed. The original cell acts as a prototype and takes an
active role in creating the copy.
